# Inverted index

## Ref

I think the tutorial in YDN is the best, from intro to the solution to inverted index

## Hints

- In MapReduce, all of the output values are not usually reduced together. All of the values with the same key are presented to a single reducer together
- Both are Hadoop APIs but org.apache.hadoop.mapred is the older API and org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce is the new one. And it was done to allow programmers write MapReduce jobs in a more convenient, easier and sophisticated fashion
- The Combiner is a "mini-reduce" process which operates only on data generated by one machine.


## FAQ

see `text/errors`

- use `mapreduce` instead of `marped`, the former is the latest api
- `map`, `combine`, `reduces` should have same type of output.
- use `Iterable` instead of `Iterator`, the latter will call superclass's reduce instead of mine. see http://hadoop-common.472056.n3.nabble.com/Hadoop-Reduce-is-never-called-td1812851.html
