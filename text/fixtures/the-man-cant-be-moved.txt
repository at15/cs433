going back to the corner where I first saw you
gonna cramp in my sleeping bag not gonna move
but I am not broke I am just a broken hearted man
cause if one day you wake up and find yourself missing me
and your heart start to wonder where on earth I could be
maybe you will come back to the place that we meet
and see me waiting for you on the corner of the street
I am not moving
I am not moving
