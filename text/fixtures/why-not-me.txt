escaping nights without you
shadows on the floor
my heart is broken up
trying hard not to fall
you say that you love me
now we are just friends
my heart is broken up into pieces cause I know
I will never free my soul
just struggle between true love and been alone
when my eyes are closed
greatest story told
woke up my dreams all shattered here on the floor
so tell me baby
why oh why baby why not me
why oh why we were meant to be
baby I know I could be all you need
why oh why
so why not me
